## 3D Dynamic Analysis: Fixed-Wing Aircraft with a Suspended Load
Objective: To derive and simulate the complex equations of motion for a multi-body system consisting of a fixed-wing aircraft and a dynamically coupled suspended load.
Methodology: Utilized **Lagrangian Formalism** to derive the full 3D coupled equations of motion, accounting for the dynamic interaction between the aircraft and the payload.
Complexity: Developed the system's full 3D dynamics, resulting in higly non-linear coupled equations of motion with over 25 trigonometric terms per state variable to ensure high-fidelity simulation accuracy.
Simulation & Verification: Implemented the model in a high-fidelity simulation environment to analyze flight stability and the impact of the pendulum effect on aircraft maneuvering.
